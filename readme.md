# RSI Ship Price Scraper

Scrapes prices of all buyable ships on the RSI Pledge Store.

Build artifacts can be found in the [Actions-tab](https://github.com/StarCitizenWiki/ship-price-scraper/actions) under each workflow result.

Note: Artifacts can only be downloaded by logged-in users.  
Alternatively the workflow log output from the `npm install` step can be copied, as it is the same content as the uploaded artifact.
